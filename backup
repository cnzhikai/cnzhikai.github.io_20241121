 The recent success of artificial intelligence underscores the importance of big data, a trend also evident in biomedical research. Three-dimensional biological models, such as organoids, hold great promise for various applications, including high-throughput drug screening. However, current technologies struggle to interface with these models efficiently, limiting our ability to fully understand their potential. To address this, I propose a CMOS-integrated three-dimensional microsystem that combines the information-processing power of electronic chips with shape-programmable 3D microrobotic structures for intimate biological interfacing. This technology could significantly advance next-generation biomedical research and applications.

Building CMOS-Integrated Micro-Robotic Device and System for Three-Dimensional Cells and Organoids Interfacing.

About
I am developing CMOS-integrated micro-robotic device and system for interfacing three-dimensional cell spheroids and organoids, which possess more complex cytoarchitectures. The developed technology enables precise control and monitoring of biosamples with their microenvironments, advancing tissue engineering, drug testing, and biomedical research, ultimately facilitates advancements in next-generation medical and therapeutic applications.

Short bio - I am a Ph.D. student at the integrated devices, electronics, and system (IDEAS) group at the department of information technology and electrical engineering, ETH Zurich, where I also obtained my master degree in biomedical engineering. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng in microelectronics from Xi'an Jiaotong University and was a visiting research intern at department of physics, McGill university. Contact me at zhhuang @ ethz.ch for any inquires.
